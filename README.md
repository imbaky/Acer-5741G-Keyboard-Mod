Acer-5741G-Keyboard-Mod
=======================

##Introduction

When I first got my laptop a few years ago, I thought it was perfect but it was just missing one thing....the keyboard didn't have any lights and it was difficult to code at night.
So I decide to change that and add lights to the keyboard.


##But how?

After some research I discovered that there is another model of Acer that had an identical keyboard but with an extra flex-cable to power the lights but it would take a few modifications for it to work.
